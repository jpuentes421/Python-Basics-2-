7. Now we want to create a python file and input statements inside of that file so it executes as a program. Type **quit()** to exit the REPL.
8. Create a file. The 1st statement is assigning a value to a variable: **line01 = '******************'** (insert 20 asteriks)
9. To copy the statement, press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + down arrow to copy data down. 
10. Change variables to line02, and line03.
11. In the middle, (line02) remove the asteriks and space it back over to the edges.
12. For line03, remove the asteriks and space 5 times, type **Welcome**, then insert 5 more spaces.
13. Insert print ('') and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, will print empty string.
14. Insert **print (line01)**
15. Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + down arrow  to copy 5 times.
16. Change the 2nd line to line02, the third line to line03, the fourth line to line04, and the 5th line to line05.
17. Run the file.
18. Created a banner.
19. Can use # to create notes.

**Welcome banner**
